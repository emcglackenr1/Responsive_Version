<h1> Portfolio - Responsive Version </h1>


This is a basic demo of how I am changing the portfolio website to make it responsive.

The current version can be seen here:

This version will use jquery, as well as streamlined and simplified CSS and HTML. 

I have learned a lot since I originally wrote most of the code for the portfolio website. So, I wanted to apply some of the new knowledge and techniques I have gained to improve the project.

It is still a work in progress so the other pages are still to be changed.
